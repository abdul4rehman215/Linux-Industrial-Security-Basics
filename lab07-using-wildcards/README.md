# 🧪 Lab 07: Using Wildcards

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Cloud Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of wildcards in file management
- Learn how to use wildcards to perform file operations efficiently
- Gain hands-on experience using cp and rm with wildcards

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the Unix/Linux command line
- Familiarity with file operations such as cp and rm

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Wildcards:** Special characters used to match filenames
- **Pattern Matching:** Selecting multiple files using patterns instead of exact names

Common wildcards:
- `*` → Matches any number of characters
- `?` → Matches exactly one character

## 🧩 Lab Tasks & Execution

### 🔹 Task 1: Copy Multiple Files Using Wildcards

**Concept:**  
Wildcards allow copying multiple files without specifying each filename manually.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Remove Selected Files Using Wildcards

**Concept:**  
Wildcards can also be used with rm to delete specific groups of files.
Extra caution is required when using wildcards with delete operations.

## ✅ Conclusion
In this lab, wildcard characters `*` and `?` were used to efficiently manage files in a
Unix/Linux environment. These tools enable bulk file operations, improve productivity,
and reduce repetitive command usage for system administrators and security engineers.
