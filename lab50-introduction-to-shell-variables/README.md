# 🧪 Lab 50: Introduction to Shell Variables

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Cloud Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor  
**Shell:** Bash (/bin/bash)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what shell variables are
- Create and use local shell variables
- Create and use global (exported) variables
- Understand special shell variables

---

## 📖 Introduction
Shell variables are used to store data that can be referenced by commands
and scripts during execution. They are fundamental to Bash scripting,
automation, and system administration. Linux provides local variables,
exported variables, and special variables for runtime information.

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks
- Create and access local variables
- Export variables for child shells
- Use special shell variables such as `$?`, `$$`, and `$#`

---

## 🔐 Security Relevance
Environment variables may store sensitive data such as API keys or
credentials. Improper handling can expose secrets to child processes
or other users.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how to work with shell variables in Bash.
Understanding variable scope and special variables is essential for
writing reliable scripts and automating Linux tasks.
