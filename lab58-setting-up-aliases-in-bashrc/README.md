# 🧪 Lab 58: Setting Up Aliases in .bashrc

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Cloud / Virtual Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor  
**Shell:** Bash

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what aliases are
- Create persistent aliases in .bashrc
- Reload shell configuration without restarting
- Verify alias persistence across sessions

---

## 📖 Introduction
Aliases are shortcuts that map long or frequently used commands to short,
easy-to-remember names. Defining aliases in the .bashrc file ensures they
are automatically available in every new terminal session, improving
efficiency and reducing typing errors.

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks
- Locate and edit the .bashrc file
- Add custom aliases
- Reload shell configuration
- Verify alias persistence

---

## 🔐 Security Relevance
Aliases can be used to add safety mechanisms (e.g., `rm -i`) to prevent
accidental destructive actions. Misconfigured aliases, however, may
override critical commands and cause confusion.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how to create and manage persistent aliases using
.bashrc. Proper use of aliases improves productivity and adds an extra
layer of safety to everyday command-line usage.
