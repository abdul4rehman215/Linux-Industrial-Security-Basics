## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn basic commands for viewing file contents in Linux
- Extract and inspect specific parts of files
- Search for text patterns inside files
- Understand practical use cases of head, tail, more, and grep

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic terminal usage knowledge
- Access to a Linux-based system or terminal emulator

## 🧩 Lab Tasks & Execution

### 📁 Preparation: Create a Sample File

A sample text file is created to demonstrate file viewing and search operations.

---

### 🔹 Task 1: Viewing the Beginning of a File Using `head`

**Concept:**  
The `head` command displays the first lines of a file and is useful for quickly inspecting
file headers or initial content.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Viewing the End of a File Using `tail`

**Concept:**  
The `tail` command displays the last lines of a file and is commonly used for monitoring
recent log entries.

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Paging Through a File Using `more`

**Concept:**  
The `more` command allows paginated viewing of files, making large files easier to read.

---

### 🔹 Task 4: Searching Text Using `grep`

**Concept:**  
The `grep` command searches for text patterns inside files and supports case-insensitive
and recursive searches.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
In this lab, essential Linux commands for viewing and searching file contents were practiced.
Commands such as `head`, `tail`, and `more` help inspect files efficiently, while `grep`
enables powerful text searching. These tools are especially valuable when working with
configuration files, logs, and large datasets in real-world Linux and cybersecurity
environments.
