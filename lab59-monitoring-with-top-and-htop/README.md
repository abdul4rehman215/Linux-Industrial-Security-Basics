# 🧪 Lab 59: Monitoring with top and htop

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Cloud / Virtual Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor  
**Shell:** Bash  
**Privileges:** sudo

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand real-time system monitoring
- Use `top` for basic process monitoring
- Install and use `htop`
- Compare `top` and `htop`
- Sort processes by CPU and memory usage

---

## 📖 Introduction
System monitoring tools help administrators understand system health,
performance bottlenecks, and resource usage in real time.

`top` is installed by default on most Linux systems, while `htop` provides
a more interactive, color-coded interface with mouse support.

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks
- Install htop
- Monitor system using top
- Monitor system using htop
- Sort processes by CPU and memory
- Exit monitoring tools safely

---

## 🔐 Security & Operations Relevance
Monitoring tools are critical for:
- Detecting runaway processes
- Identifying resource exhaustion
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Performance troubleshooting

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This lab demonstrated real-time system monitoring using top and htop.
Understanding these tools is essential for system administration,
incident response, and performance optimization.
