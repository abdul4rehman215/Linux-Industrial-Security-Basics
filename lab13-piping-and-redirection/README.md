# 🧪 Lab 13: Using Piping and Redirection

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Cloud Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand input and output redirection in Linux
- Redirect command output to files
- Append output to existing files
- Use pipes to connect multiple commands

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Linux commands
- Access to a Linux command-line interface

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks & Execution

### 🔹 Task 1: Redirect Output to a File
Linux commands normally display output on the terminal.
Redirection allows saving that output into a file.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Append Output to a File
Appending allows adding data to an existing file without overwriting it.

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Use Pipes to Chain Commands
Piping sends the output of one command directly as input to another.

## ✅ Conclusion
In this lab, output redirection and piping were used to control how command results
are handled in Linux. These techniques are essential for scripting, automation,
log analysis, and efficient command-line workflows.
