# 🧪 Lab 19: Compressing with gzip and bzip2

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Cloud Lab Environment)  
**User:** toor  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand file compression and decompression concepts
- Compress files using gzip and bzip2
- Decompress files using gunzip and bunzip2
- Compare gzip and bzip2 usage

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Linux files and directories
- Access to a Linux terminal
- gzip and bzip2 installed

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks & Execution

### 🔹 Task 1: Compress and Decompress Using gzip
gzip is commonly used for fast compression of individual files.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Compress and Decompress Using bzip2
bzip2 provides higher compression ratios but is slower than gzip.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
In this lab, files were compressed and decompressed using gzip and bzip2.
Understanding these tools helps optimize storage, backups, and data transfers
in Linux systems.
