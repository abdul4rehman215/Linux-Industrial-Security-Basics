## 🔐 Security-Focused Labs

Security relevance is **explicitly documented only where applicable**, including:
- Secure deletion of sensitive files
- Log analysis and rotation
- Cron job monitoring
- Process inspection
- SELinux access control

This ensures **real-world relevance** without unnecessary theory.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Commands Used

These labs involve hands-on usage of essential Linux commands and utilities, including:

- `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`
- `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `mv`, `rm`
- `touch`, `cat`, `less`, `more`
- `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`
- `ln`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`
- `bash`, `sh`

These commands form the foundation of daily Linux usage and scripting.

---

## 🔐 Security Relevance

These labs build the Linux knowledge required to:

- Safely handle files, directories, and permissions
- Avoid accidental data exposure and misconfiguration
- Navigate Linux systems securely and confidently
- Prepare for **SOC**, **Cloud**, **DevOps**, and **Linux Administration** roles

Security concepts are introduced **practically**, only where they are relevant, to reflect real-world usage rather than theoretical overload.

---

## 💼 Interview Preparation Included

Each lab contains:
- **5–10 job-oriented interview questions**
- One-line, concise answers
- Based on **real hiring expectations**, not textbook theory

Perfect for:
- Linux Admin roles
- SOC / Security roles
- DevOps & Cloud roles
- Entry-level to mid-level interviews

---

## ⚙️ Execution Notes

- Commands are stored in `commands.sh`
- Outputs are captured separately in `output.txt`
- Troubleshooting focuses on **practical failure cases**
- No fabricated results — outputs reflect real execution behavior
